You see, you are in no position to judge Draco Lucius Malfoy, you filthy muggle. What side is choose is the <b>Right</b> side and will always be.

Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, I imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families." — Draco Malfoy.

        <p class="intro_para"><br>The day begins at Hogwarts with breakfast in the Great Hall. Students sit at their own House table and can eat and socialise, or finish homework. The Headmaster or Headmistress eats with the professors at the High Table placed at the far end of the hall. During breakfast, owls bring in the students' post, generally consisting of The Daily Prophet, letters from parents or friends, or packages from home. A bell signals the start of the first class of the morning at 9 am.
